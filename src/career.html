        <h2>Intro</h2>
        <p>
            Keanu Reeves was born on September 2, 1964, in Beirut, Lebanon, and was raised in Toronto, Canada. He first
            gained attention for his performance in River's Edge, while the comedy Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure and
            its sequel, Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey, brought him major recognition. Reeves has developed an eclectic film
            roster that includes the action flick Speed and the sci-fi blockbusters The Matrix and its sequels, as well
            as more art-house fare like My Own Private Idaho and The Private Lives of Pippa Lee. Reeves made his
            directorial debut in 2013 with Man of Tai Chi.

            His artistic aspirations not limited to film, Reeves co-founded the band Dogstar in the early 1990s. Dogstar
            enjoyed modest success, releasing two albums during Reeves' decade-long run as its bass player. He later
            played bass for a band called Becky for about a year.

            Reeves is also a longtime motorcycle enthusiast. After asking designer Gard Hollinger to create a
            custom-built bike for him, the two went into business together with the formation of Arch Motorcycle Company
            LLC in 2011.
